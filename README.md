# nvpro-samples

The `build_all` repository is optional and contains scripts that allow you to synchronize and build all the samples that you have cloned using a single solution.

* CMakeLists.txt: the CMake file that will walk through samples to include them in the project
* legacy/CMakeLists.txt: CMake file that only builds samples not yet ported to nvpro_core2
* README.md: this file
* LICENSE: the license used for all nvpro-samples
* batch/script files: allows to easily clone/pull/build all samples

Running the `clone_all` batch/script will create the following directory structure:

```output
ðŸ“‚ build_all
   ðŸ“‚ nvpro_core
   ðŸ“‚ nvpro_core2
   ðŸ“‚ samples
      ðŸ“‚ ... (all repositories specified in the script)
```

Each sample can be built either individually, using `build_all.bat` to automate the process, or with `build_all/CMakeLists.txt` to build them all as a single solution.
* To build a single sample: `cd` into the sample's folder, then run `cmake -S . -B cmake_build` followed by `cmake --build cmake_build --parallel`.
* To build all the samples by themselves: Run `build_all` (.bat or .sh, depending on your platform)
* To build all the samples in a single solution: Run `cmake -S . -B cmake_build` in the build_all folder, followed by `cmake --build cmake_build --parallel`.
* To build only the samples that haven't been ported to nvpro_core2 yet: Run `cmake -S legacy -B cmake_build` followed by `cmake --build cmake_build --parallel`.
* To build only "version 2" samples: Run `cmake -S . -B cmake_build -DNVPRO_SAMPLES_NO_V1_SAMPLES=ON` followed by `cmake --build cmake_build --parallel`.

You can also configure the solution for `build_all` to only include a subset of projects with the appropriate `BUILD_sample_name` checkbox in the CMake UI. `build_all/legacy/CMakeLists.txt` will build only the samples not yet ported to nvpro_core2.

All samples must be built for a 64-bit architecture. All samples support Windows (MSVC 2019 is our minimum compiler), while nearly all support Linux as well (GCC 10.5 is our minimum compiler there). If you're using a compiler other than MSVC (Visual Studio), GCC, or Clang, your compiler must allow specifying C++20, and provide support for some basic C++20 features such as designated initializers.

## Linux prerequisites

The samples attempt to pull in third-party dependencies automatically. But there are a few system libraries they depend on. CMake may not pick up all dependencies during the setup phase and compilation will bail out due to missing headers. The following line installs many of the potentially missing system library headers and libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxxf86vm-dev libtbb-dev
```

Installing the latest Vulkan SDK is recommended. Please follow the instructions on https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/linux/getting_started.html under "Download the SDK" and "Install the SDK".

Additionally, the samples require CMake 3.22 or higher.

# Shared Dependencies

* [nvpro_core](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core): The primary framework that all samples depend on. Contains window management, UI, and various API helpers.

* [nvpro_core2](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core2): The next-gen version of nvpro_core, modernized and cleaned up.

# Mega Geometry

## [vk_animated_clusters](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_animated_clusters)

![A large number of Stanford Bunnies. Each one independently deforms, changing the position of every triangle, every frame.](doc/vk_animated_clusters.jpg)

This sample introduces clusters and shows how to use the
`VK_NV_cluster_acceleration_structure` extension to ray trace massive,
animated scenes. It also shows how clusterized models can be efficiently
rasterized using mesh shaders. With RTX Mega Geometry, acceleration structures
for animated objects can be built faster than using previous APIs.

* VK_NV_cluster_acceleration_structure

**Tags**: ray tracing, clusters, mesh shaders, animation, glTF, CLAS, RTX Mega Geometry


## [vk_lod_clusters](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_lod_clusters)

![A large number of Stanford Bunnies. Although the level of detail varies across bunnies and across groups per bunny, the rendering is seamless.](doc/vk_lod_clusters.jpg)

This sample showcases a continuous level of detail (LoD) technique using
clusters that leverages `VK_NV_cluster_acceleration_structure` for ray tracing.
It can also rasterize the content using `VK_NV_mesh_shader`.
Furthermore, the sample implements an on-demand streaming system from RAM to
VRAM for the geometry.

* VK_NV_cluster_acceleration_structure

**Tags**: ray tracing, clusters, mesh shaders, glTF, CLAS, RTX Mega Geometry

## [vk_tessellated_clusters](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_tessellated_clusters)

![A close-up of a tessellated brick wall. Its surface is divided into base triangles. Tessellated base triangles are split into clusters of many smaller triangles every frame.](doc/vk_tessellated_clusters.jpg)

This sample showcases how to use clusters and
`VK_NV_cluster_acceleration_structure` to path trace dynamic tessellation with
displacement, which requires per-frame generation of geometry.
It can also render the content using `VK_NV_mesh_shader`.

* VK_NV_cluster_acceleration_structure

**Tags**: ray tracing, clusters, mesh shaders, glTF, CLAS, RTX Mega Geometry


## [vk_partitioned_tlas](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_partitioned_tlas)

![Over 100,000 dominoes tumble under arches and next to icosahedra. The world is divided into tiles; tiles where dominoes tumble -- where parts of the partitioned TLAS are being updated -- are in brighter colors.](doc/vk_partitioned_tlas.jpg)

Frequently, only parts of a scene change between frames. The new
`VK_NV_partitioned_acceleration_structure` extension allows apps to rebuild parts of a TLAS when
part of a scene changes, rather than the whole thing. This sample showcases this
extension using a simple simulation of more than 100 000 physics objects.

* VK_NV_partitioned_acceleration_structure

**Tags**: ray tracing, TLAS, RTX Mega Geometry, toon shading

## [nv_cluster_builder](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_builder)
![](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_builder/raw/main/doc/clusters.svg)

nv_cluster_builder is a small generic spatial clustering C++ library, created to cluster triangle meshes for ray tracing. It implements an algorithm similar to the recursive node-splitting techniques sometimes used to create bounding volume hierarchies. While it is limited to axis-aligned splits, its outputs work well for ray tracing.

**Tags**: clusters, RTX Mega Geometry

## [nv_cluster_lod_builder](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder)
![](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nv_cluster_lod_builder/raw/main/doc/lod_stitch.svg)

nv_lod_cluster_builder is a continuous level of detail (LoD) mesh library that enables fine-grained control over geometric detail within a mesh, compared to traditional discrete LoD. Clusters of triangles are carefully precomputed by decimating the original mesh in a way that they can be seamlessly combined across different LoD levels. At rendering time, a subset of these clusters can be selected to adaptively provide the required amount of detail as the camera navigates the scene.

**Tags**: clusters, RTX Mega Geometry

# Vulkan Ray Tracing and Path Tracing Samples

* Using any hit shaders
* Using memory managers for handling many objects and instances
* Using an intersection shader and rendering implicit geometries
* Jittering camera ray generation and image accumulation for anti-aliased images

This example demonstrates NRD, "NVIDIA Real-Time Denoisers", in a simple path tracer rendering a glTF scene. NRD is a spatio-temporal post-processing library that removes noise from Monte-Carlo based path tracers. NRD is not just a single denoiser, in fact it is a collection of specialized denoisers for specific kinds of data, like diffuse and specular images, ambient occlusion, and shadow data.

## [gl_occlusion_culling](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/gl_occlusion_culling)

![screenshot-gl_occlusion_culling](doc/gl_occlusion_culling.png)

Sample for shader-based occlusion culling, which is more scalable on modern GPUs
than traditional occlusion query techniques. Also showcases how to generate
drawcalls on the GPU, so that occlusion culling techniques don't need CPU
readbacks.

## [gl_vrs](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/gl_vrs)

![Two screenshots of the gl_vrs sample side by side. On the left, the sample renders 1000 tori. The shading rate for the blue tori decreases as the distance to the center increases; in the periphery, they are not rendered at all. The green tori, on the other hand, are always rendered at full (1x1) shading rate. On the right, the sample shows the shading rate per pixel.](doc/gl_vrs.png)

Demonstrates Variable Rate Shading â€” which allows hardware to shade primitives at a different frequency than the rasterization frequency â€” in OpenGL. The user can pick various rates, including shading rates that vary over the image. This is especially useful for optimizations like foveated rendering in VR.

## [vk_gaussian_splatting](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_gaussian_splatting)
![](doc/vk_gaussian_splatting.jpg)

This project explores real-time visualization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with Vulkan, comparing rasterization-based techniques using mesh and vertex shaders, along with GPU and CPU sorting strategies.


# DirectX 12 Samples

## [dx12_present_barrier](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/dx12_present_barrier)

![screenshot-dx12_present_barrier](doc/dx12_present_barrier.jpg)

This sample demonstrates the usage of the new NvAPI interface to synchronize
present calls between windows on the same system as well as on distributed
systems. It can also be used to check if systems are configured to support
synchronized present through DirectX 12 present barrier. A general overview of
the interface can be found on the [NVIDIA developer blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/synchronizing-present-calls-between-applications-on-distributed-systems-with-directx-12/).

# Other APIs

## [nvml_enterprise_gpu_check](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvml_enterprise_gpu_check)

Shows how to correctly load the [NVML library for GPU information](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml), and to robustly check
using NVML's API if a GPU is an Enterprise/Quadro GPU. (This works even when the GPU,
such as the RTX A6000, doesn't have "Quadro" in its name.)

*([full resolution compression comparison here](https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/nvtt/marbles-astc-repeat.png))*

Shows how to use [NVTT 3](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-accelerated-texture-compression), a GPU-accelerated texture compression and image processing library. This includes several small samples intended as tutorials â€” such as a program that uses NVTT to load an image and compress it to a one-mipmap DDS file using BC7 block compression in less than 250 C++ characters â€” and the source code for several tools from NVTT 3 ported to the nvpro-samples framework.
