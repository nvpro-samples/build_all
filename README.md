# nvpro-samples

The `build_all` repository is optional and contains scripts that allow you to synchronize and build all the samples that you have cloned using a single solution.

* CMakeLists.txt: the CMake file that will walk through samples to include them in the project
* README.md: this file
* LICENSE: the license used for all nvpro-samples
* batch/script files: allows to easily clone/pull all existing samples

Running the `clone_all` batch/script will create the following directory structure:



| :warning: |**Make sure to place the build_all repository into its own separate directory**! |
| --- | --- |
| | Use, for instance, 'nvpro-samples'. This prevents the clone_all script from polluting, for example, your home directory. 'clone_all' will place all individual nvpro-samples right next to build_all. |

```bash
nvpro-samples
    build_all
    nvpro_core
    ... (all repositories specified in the script)
```

Each sample can be built either individually, or with `build_all/CMakeLists.txt` as single solution. You can also configure the solution for `build_all` to only include a subset of projects with the appropriate `BUILD_sample_name` checkbox in the CMake UI.

All samples must be built for a 64-bit architecture. All samples support Windows (MSVC 2019 is our minimum compiler), while nearly all support Linux as well (GCC 9.4 is our minimum compiler there). If you're using a compiler other than MSVC (Visual Studio), GCC, or Clang, your compiler must support C++17, a few samples require compiler support for basic C++20 features like designated initializers.

## Linux prerequisites

The samples attempt to pull in third-party dependencies automatically. But there are a few system libraries they depend on. CMake may not pick up all dependencies during the setup phase and compilation will bail out due to missing headers. The following line installs many of the potentially missing system library headers and libraries:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxxf86vm-dev libvulkan-dev libglm-dev libfreeimage-dev
# not necessary, but recommended
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
```
Additionally, the samples require CMake 3.10 or higher.

# Shared Dependencies

* [nvpro_core](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core): The primary framework that all samples depend on. Contains window management, UI, and various API helpers.


# Vulkan Samples

These samples are "pure" Vulkan samples and use its WSI system to create the window swapchain.

## [vk_async_resources](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_async_resources)

![screenshot-vk_async_resources](doc/vk_async_resources.png)

The basic sample describes a strategy that delays deletion of Vulkan resources for a few frames.
Furthermore Vulkan provides multiple ways to upload data to the device, three different approaches
are described.

* VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing
* GL_EXT_nonuniform_qualifier

# OpenGL / Vulkan Samples

These samples use the `gl_vk_` prefix and showcase Vulkan and OpenGL techniques within
the same application (`gl_vk_sample_name.exe`) or just Vulkan alone (`vk_sample_name.exe`). If available, using the `BUILD_gl_vk_sample_name_VULKAN_ONLY` option, you can omit building the combined executable file. The `VULKAN_ONLY` mode uses Vulkan's WSI system to create the swapchain, the combined executable uses `GL_NV_draw_vulkan_image`.
